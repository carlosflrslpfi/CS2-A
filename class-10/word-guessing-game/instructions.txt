Word Guessing Game

Copy the starter code and the words.txt file.

On this assignment you will be required to fill out two functions
that will complete the word guessing game. I've provided the logic of the
game. All you have to do is fill out the following two functions to make
the game work:

    - valid_guess(guess, guessed_letter)
        - inputs:
          guess - the letter guessed by the player
          guessed_letters - a list of letters previously guessed by the player
        - output:
          This function returns a boolean, True if the guess is valid, and
          False if the guess is not valid.
          This function should also __print__ a message letting the player know if the
          guess is valid or not.
        - requirements:
          The guess is valid if the letter has not been guessed before and is a letter
          of the alphabet, otherwise the guess is not valid. The guess has to be a single letter.
          - valid_guess('a', ['b', 'a']) -> False
          - valid_guess('b', ['a']) -> True
          - valid_guess('4', ['a', 'b']) -> False
    - guess_progress(guess, word_progress, secret_word)
        - inputs:
          guess - the letter guessed by the player
          word_progress - the current word progress (including previous correct guesses)
          secret_word - the randomly selected secret word
        - output:
          This function returns a string that represent the word progress
        - requirements:
          Here are a couple examples:
          - guess_progress('p', 'a___e', 'apple') -> 'app_e'
          - guess_progress('o', 'w_w', 'wow') -> 'wow'
          - guess_progress('e', '_ll_n', 'allen') -> '_llen'

This is what a typical game play will look like:

Starting game!

The rules of the game are:

    1. The computer chooses a random word
    2. You will try to guess the letters in the word one by one
    3. You are allowed to miss 6 times, after that you lose the game
    4. You win by guessing all letters correctly

Good luck!
