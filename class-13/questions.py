# dictionary. Replace every occurrence of a key in the list
# with the keys corresponding value, and return the modified list

# Question 3: Write a function that prints a list of words, then using
# the function from Question 2 change a couple words and print the
# newly modified sentence.
# Here are the steps:
# 1. Come up with a sentence and assign it to a variable
# 2. Print the sentence
# 3. Using the your_sentence.split(' ') function turn the item into a list
#       of words.
# 4. Using the list from step 3 and a dictionary, use the function
#       from Question 2 replace some of the words in the sentence
# 5. Using the list returned in step 4 create a sentence using
#       ' '.join(your_list) and print it
# Example output:
# >>> q3()
# 'I like coffee`
# {'I': 'You', 'coffee': 'tea'}
# 'You like tea'
def q3():
    # Write your code here
    pass
