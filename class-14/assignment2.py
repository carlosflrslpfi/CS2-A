# Answer the following questions in a new python file.
#
# Question 1: Write a function called sum_dictionary_values that sums all the values in a dictionary. Assume the values will always be numbers.
# Example:
# >>> stones_songs = {'Start Me Up': 6, 'Wild Horses': 10, 'Angie': 2}
# >>> sum_dictionary_values(stones_songs)
# 18
#
# Question 2: Write a function named flatten that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a single dictionary. The result should contain all the values from the dictionaries in the list in no particular order.
# Example:
# >>> beatles_songs = {'Eleanor Rigby': 3, 'Help': 5, 'Blackbird': 7}
# >>> stones_songs = {'Start Me Up': 6, 'Wild Horses': 10, 'Angie': 2}
# >>> list_of_dictionaries = [beatles_songs, stones_songs]
# >>> flatten(list_of_dictionaries)
# {'Eleanor Rigby': 3, 'Start Me Up': 6, 'Help': 5, 'Blackbird': 7, 'Wild Horses': 10, 'Angie': 2}
