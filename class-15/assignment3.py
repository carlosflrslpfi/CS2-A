# Q0: go to http://www.simplyscripts.com/a.html and pick a movie you like.
# Create a text file in the same directory as your python file and paste
# the text there. Use this file to complete the following questions:

# Q1: Write a function that counts the number of times the word
# 'universe' is in the script.

# Q2: Write a function that has a words as input and count the number
# of times that word appears in the script.

# Q3: Write a function that creates a dictionary and counts the number
# of times each word in the script is used. Hint: to get a list of
# words from a line use line.strip('\n').split(" ").

# Q4: Write a function that returns a list of the top 10 used words.
# Hint 1: to sort a dictionary use:
#   sorted_d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# where 'd' is the dictionary.
# Hint 2: Use the previous function.
